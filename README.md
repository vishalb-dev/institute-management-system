  - `conio.h` library
  - `gotoxy()` function
  - DOS-based console operations

### Dependencies
- `stdio.h`: Standard I/O operations
- `conio.h`: Console I/O functions
- `string.h`: String manipulation functions

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone or Download**: Get the source code files
2. **Compiler Setup**: Ensure you have Turbo C or compatible compiler installed
3. **Compilation**: Compile the main source file
4. **Execution**: Run the executable in a DOS-compatible environment


## Usage Guide

### Starting the System
1. Run the executable file
2. The system displays a welcome message for the admin
3. Navigate through the main menu using number keys

### Main Menu Options
- **1**: Access Student Portal
- **2**: Access Course Portal  
- **3**: Exit the system

- Course validation ensures students enroll in existing courses
- File integrity maintained through temporary file operations
- Input validation for numeric fields

## Limitations

- DOS-based console application (not cross-platform)
- Text-based interface only
- File-based storage (no database integration)
- Single-user system (no concurrent access)
- Limited to Turbo C/DOS environment

## Future Enhancements

- Database integration (MySQL/SQLite)
- Cross-platform GUI implementation
- Multi-user support with authentication
- Data export/import functionality
- Advanced search and filtering options
- Fee payment tracking system
